          <h4>Google</h4>
          <p>
            I'm currently working at Google[x] - specifically on
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRTNvWcx9Oo">Project
            Wing's</a> UI and cloud services.

          <h4>Willow Garage</h4>
          <p>
            Until <a href="http://www.willowgarage.com">Willow Garage</a> was
            acquired, I was working there as a Web Robotics Engineer. Really,
            it's just a title I gave myself for a full-stack engineer who deals
            with the issues of real-time, distributed robot control.
          </p>

          <h4>Previous Jobs</h4>

              <li>
